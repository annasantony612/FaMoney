# FaMoney

FaMoney is an application that assists families in keeping track of their financial situation. In our daily lives, we may be required to pay a large number of bills and installments, and we may frequently fail to do so. This application also assists families in keeping track of their payments and installments.

Our goal with this initiative is to establish an environment in which each member of a family is aware of their present financial situation.

# More About The app

Our goal with this initiative is to establish an environment in which each member of a family is aware of their present financial situation. They can see a summary of their liabilities at a glance. Knowing their financial condition, liabilities, and so on makes family members more responsible in carrying out their lives, especially children. When children learn more about their families' present financial situation, they feel more responsible to them. Members of the family may need to contact each other to determine whether or not the bills have been paid. In such instances, our application can assist families in resolving the common misconception.
Each bill or payment installment can be seen independently. Every month, users receive a reminder to pay their invoices, ensuring that they do not miss any of them. When the bills are paid, users can mark them as completed. In the case of installments, users can add the total amount they must pay and establish a monthly payment goal. When they reach the objective
and mark it as completed, this amount will be automatically deducted from the total and the remaining amount will be displayed.
